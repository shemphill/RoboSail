There is an International One Meter Class Association for sailboats with
one meter hulls, so you can find a lot of videos on YouTube for boats in
the class.  You can see them racing, etc.  Of particular interest are the
videos which show how to tune them.  For example:

Here's a hardware modification to wind the sheets in light wind:

I've read that the Ragazza does not conform to the rig/sail sizes for
any of the three subclasses of IOM, but lies between two of them.  The
class rules are at:

A note on the below experiments:

"premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it)
in programming."  (Donald Knuth)

Spending a lot of time optimzing some boat functions can prevent us from
finishing all the functionality of the boat in a timely manner.  Many of
the proposed experiments come under this category, so we should consider
them only after the boat is already performing all the tasks we want.

Experiments to try:

1.  Using a linear function to calculate mainsheet length for a given wind
    angle is a good first approximation.  But the boom angle is not a
    linear function of sheet length.  When we are ready to optimize things,
    is the sheet too tight or too loose in the middle of the range of
    travel?  Which way does the function actually curve?

  Calculate the correspondence between sheet position and boom angle:
  Origin is at the boom pivot point
  x is the position of the hole in the deck through which the sheet passes
  h is the height of the boom above the deck at the hole
  r is the distance from the origin of the sheet attachment point on the boom
  s is the sheet length
  th, i.e. theta, is the boom angle

  s^2 = (*r*cos(th)-x)^2 + (r*sin(th))^2 + h^2
  s^2 = r^2 - 2*r*x*cos(th) + h^2
  cos(th) = (r^2 + h^2 - s^2) / (2*r*x)

  Since the sheet length doesn't have a zero origin, i.e. s = s0 + s', this
  is probably best modeled as:

  cos(th) = a + b*s + c*s^2

  th and s can be measured on a real boat, and then fit with least squares
  to determine (a,b,c).

2.  I don't consider this next experiment just an optimization.  I view it
    as being essential if we are to sail in 10kts of wind or more.

    If we are determined to maintain a particular point of sail, then we
    need to control the heel angle, by letting the sheets out if the boat
    heels too much.  There are two different variables returned by the
    accelerometer code that relate to heel angle: raw y-axis acceleration,
    and a derived heel angle which is determined by the arctangent of the
    ratio between the y-axis acceleration and the z-axis acceleration.  If
    the boat is traveling at a constant velocity, then it doesn't matter
    which variable we pick to control.  If the boat is bouncing around,
    then its center of mass will be accelerating, and one of these variables
    will probably be better to control than the other.  I really don't have
    a theoretical basis for which one to pick.  I decided to choose the
    raw y-axis acceleration, since it is measured directly by the device.
    (Perhaps another experiment can be set up to show the difference
    between the two possible control variables on a choppy day.)

    Initially, I picked a target maximum heel angle of 30 degrees, which
    corresponds to a y-axis acceleration of about 4.9m/s^2.  After watching
    YouTube videos of 1-meter boats racing, I've decided to change the
    target maximum heel angle of 45 degrees, which corresponds to a y-axis
    acceleration of about 6.9m/s^2.

    A PID controller is the best way to keep the boat from heeling too
    much.  To understand what it is and how to implement it, I suggest
    looking at:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y7zG48uHRo

    Here's another good one:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fusr9eTceEo

    Then visit the Wikipedia page:

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller
    
    First, search in the page for section 10, "Pseudocode".  This shows
    you how to implement it.  Then go back to section 5.4 "Manual tuning",
    and section 5.5 "Zieglers-Nichols method".  After that, you're on your
    own.  Depending on your math background, you can read the rest of the
    Wiki article, or search the web for lots more information on the topic.

    In my implementation, the PID controller modifies the target sheet
    position that has been determined else where in the software.  I use
    the error calculation:

      error = measured_value - setpoint

    The setpoint was initially 4.9, and the measured_value was the current
    y-axis acceleration.  The error will be positive if the boat is heeling
    too much, and negative if not.  Even if the error is negative, I still
    calculate the "output", since it may be that a correction is necessary
    to keep the error near zero.  If the output is negative, then rather than
    trying to pull the sheets in to try to make the boat heel over farther,
    I set the output to zero, and also make sure that the integral in the
    pseudo code is also kept at zero.
    
    Initially, I used a Kp of 10, with Ki and Kd set to zero.  The output
    of the PID controller was used as an addition to the sheet position.
    I put the boat on the water on a stronger green flag day, and observed
    that the boat's angle of heel wasn't very well controlled.  On a lighter
    yellow flag day, I put the boat back on the water with a Kp of 20.  The
    heel angle was better controlled, and this time I had better data logging.
    The data logging captured the fact that there was an oscillation going on
    where the boat was heeling too far, the sheets were let out, then the boat
    wasn't heeling too far anymore, so the sheets were pulled in.  From the
    plot of the track, I estimated that the period of the oscillation was
    about three seconds.  At some point, I will collect the raw data from
    the log and calculate a more precise figure.  This can then be used to
    tune Kp, Ki, and Kd.  (I think I probably won't use Kd, since the
    calculated error would probably be pretty noisy, which means that the
    derivative will be all over the place.)

    A PID controller could also be used to hold a heading, whether it
    is a point of sail, a magnetic heading, or a GPS track.

    Oh, one more thing about the pseudo code on the Wikipedia page.  It
    needs to have statements to protect against integrator wind-up.  After
    "integral" is calculated, it should have something like:

      if (integral > integral_max) integral = integral_max;
      else if (integral < integral_min) integral = integral_min;

3.  To get the best compass readings, it would seem that it would be good
    to do an on-the-water calibration of the magnetometer.  The boat could
    be turned in a circle, while tabulating its extreme values.

4.  Write code that reads the RC input pulses with interrupts instead of
    pulseIn().  Right now, the code can spend up to 40ms in the two calls
    to pulseIn(), and is the limiting factor in how long it takes to
    complete one execution of the loop() function.

5.  Figure out what the best sheet position is for any given point of sail.
    The boat can be driven at a point of sail, while the sheet position is
    pulled in, and then let out maybe 5 "degrees" at a time, every five
    seconds, with the GPS position being logged to disk.  The log can be
    examined to figure out what sheet position resulted in the best
    velocity for any given point of sail.

6.  Construct a polar diagram for the boat.  Plot the maximum velocity
    as a radial distance from the origin in the direction of the relative
    wind.  This is best done on a day with constant wind.  The polar
    diagram will differ depending on the amount of wind.  The close-hauled
    point on the diagram with be the point with the maximum up-wind
    velocity.  The diagram should have points on it which are closer to
    the wind than close hauled, to show how the boat performs when it is
    "pinching".  Ideally, while this data is being collected, true course
    will also be collected, so that leeway can be calculated for each point
    of sail.

    The above can be done on days with different wind speed, so that we will
    have polar diagrams for each of those speeds.

7.  Determine the best maximum rudder angle.  If the rudder were physically
    able to point at 90 degrees, it would be useless to do so, since there
    would be no turning force, and it would act as a brake.  You get a
    similar situation with angles near 90 degrees.  Do the question is,
    just because we can turn the rudder 60 degrees, should we use the
    full range of the rudder?  I envision trying to turn away from the wind
    from close hauled to close hauled, with the rudder set at various
    positions to see what the differences are in angular velocity and
    forward velocity.

8.  Experiment to discover the best tacking technique.  We may not want to
    limit the rudder position chosen by the previous experiment because it
    might be best to achieve the highest angular velocity through the tack
    rather than maintaining forward velocity.  (I'm thinking here about
    tacking in wind/waves, which might reduce our forward velocity to zero,
    but the tack will still succeed if the angular velocity is maintained.)
